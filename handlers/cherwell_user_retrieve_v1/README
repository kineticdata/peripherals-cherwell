=== Detailed Description
This handler retrieves a Cherwell user and returns a JSON representation of the found
user. Execution starts by retrieving an Access Token from Cherwell using the client id/secret
and username/password info values. Once that is successfully retrieved, the user is retrieved.
Lastly, the fields returned are converted from an array to a simplified map of field
information in the form of {displayName: value}.
