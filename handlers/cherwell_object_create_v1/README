=== Detailed Description
This handler generically creates a Cherwell object based on inputted JSON and returns an id of the
new object after creation. Execution starts by retrieving an Access Token from Cherwell using the
client id/secret and username/password info values. Once that is successfully retrieved, the Object
Name is translated into a Business Object Id by using the /getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. Next,
a call to /getbusinessobjectemplate is made so the handler can exchange the Display Names (that are
used in the inputted Object JSON string) for Field Ids for each of the fields that should be
populated on create. Lastly, that translated JSON object is passed to /savebusinessobject to
actually create the object in Cherwell. If the call is successful, the id of the newly created
object will be returned by the handler.
