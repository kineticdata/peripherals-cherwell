=== Detailed Description
This handler generically deletes a Cherwell object given an Object name and id. Execution starts
by retrieving an Access Token from Cherwell using the client id/secret and username/password info
values. Once that is successfully retrieved, the Object Name is translated into a Business Object Id
by using the /getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. The returned Business Object Id and inputted Object
Id are then passed to the /deletebusinessobject endpoint to delete the object. An empty result set
will be returned on a successful delete.
