=== Detailed Description
This handler generically updates a Cherwell object using an inputted JSON representation to
determine what fields to update on the object. Execution starts by retrieving an Access Token from
Cherwell using the client id/secret and username/password info values. Once that is successfully
retrieved, the Object Name is translated into a Business Object Id by using the
/getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. A call to retrieve the object template is made so that
the field object/ids can be found for the fields that should be updated and lastly the call is
made to /savebusinessobject to update the included fields on the inputted object. An empty result
set will be returned on a successful call.
