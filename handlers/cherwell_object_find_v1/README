Generically searches for objects from Cherwell.

=== Parameters

[Filters]
  A JSON object with key/value pairs that will be searched for equality.
[Max Results]
  The maximum amount of results that can be returned in a single handler execution (if blank, as
  many as possible will be returned).

=== Sample Configuration
Object Name:            Incident
Fields to Return:

[JSON Results]
  JSON representations of the objects that match the inputted filters.
[Count]
  Total records returned in the JSON Results array.
[Total Matched]
  Total records that matched the filters on the Cherwell server.

=== Detailed Description
This handler generically searches for Cherwell objects given a map of Display Names and Values to
search on equality and returns a JSON array of the matching objects. Execution starts by retrieving
an Access Token from Cherwell using the client id/secret and username/password info values. Once
that is successfully retrieved, the Object Name is translated into a Business Object Id by using
the /getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. The /getbusinessobjecttemplate endpoint is then called to
exchange the Display Names in the filter for Field Ids (which is what Cherwell's API expects). The
search is then sent with the various options to the server and returns JSON representations of the
objects that match the filter (up to the max results size -- pagination is not currently implemented
so the max results is currently just there to protect against killing the server if a filter set
matches more records than expected). On a successful call, the handler will return the JSON Results,
the amount of records that are returned in the results, and the amount of records that were matched
overall (even if they weren't returned in the results).
