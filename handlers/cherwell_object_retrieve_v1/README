=== Detailed Description
This handler generically retrieves a Cherwell object and returns a JSON representation of the found
object. Execution starts by retrieving an Access Token from Cherwell using the client id/secret and
username/password info values. Once that is successfully retrieved, the Object Name is translated
into a Business Object Id by using the /getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. The returned Business
Object Id and inputted Object Id are then passed to the /getbusinessobject endpoint to retrieve the
full matching object. Lastly, the fields return are converted from an array to a simplified map of
field information in the form of {displayName: value}.
