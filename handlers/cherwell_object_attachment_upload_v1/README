=== Detailed Description
This handler generically uploads an attachment to a Cherwell object and return a list of the
attachment ids that were generated. Execution starts by retrieving an Access Token from Cherwell
using the client id/secret and username/password info values. Once that is successfully retrieved,
the Request CE info values and inputs are used to retrieve all attachments from the specified
submission value (both single and multiple attachments on a single field work). Once a temporary
link is generated for an attachment, the handler then downloads the attachment content and then
immediately uploads it to the specified object in Cherwell. This process is repeated for however
many attachments exist in the specified submission value and the attachment ids returned by Cherwell
are returned as handler results if all attachment uploads are successful.
