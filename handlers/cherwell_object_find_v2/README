=== Detailed Description
This handler generically searches for Cherwell objects given a map of Field Names, Operators and Values
search on equality and returns a JSON array of the matching objects. Execution starts by retrieving
an Access Token from Cherwell using the client id/secret and username/password info values. Once
that is successfully retrieved, the Object Name is translated into a Business Object Id by using
the /getbusinessobjectsummary endpoint. The /getbusinessobjecttemplate endpoint is then called to
exchange the Display Names in the filter for Field Ids (which is what Cherwell's API expects). The
search is then sent with the various options to the server and returns JSON representations of the
objects that match the filters (up to the max results size -- pagination is not currently implemented
so the max results is currently just there to protect against killing the server if a filter set
matches more records than expected). On a successful call, the handler will return the JSON Results,
the amount of records that are returned in the results, and the amount of records that were matched
overall (even if they weren't returned in the results).

Note that field names for the Fields to Return or fields used in filters can use either the display
name or the name or the name of the field.  Example: Created Date Time <or> CreatedDateTime
